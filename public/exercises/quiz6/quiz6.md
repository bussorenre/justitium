------
This exercise checks the programing skill to utilize strings.

### Required Knowledge
* Array
* Strings

Problem
------
"Never odd or even" is a sentence which is the same string even if we read in the reverse way. Those sentences are called palindromes.  
Make a program which prints YES, if a sentence is a palindrome. Otherwise, it should print NO.  
You can get a sentence from the standard input.  
It does not matter if you ignore any non-alphabetic character.  
It is not case-sensitive.  

Input
