Summary
------
This exercise checks the programming skill to utilize array.

### Required knowledge
* Array
* format specifiers

Problem
------

Write a program which calculates and prints a dot product of two vectors, A and B.  
You can get an integer, N, from the standard input at first, to know the dimension of the vectors.
Second, you can get components of vector A and components of vector B.  


Input
-----------
You should specify N (1 <= N <= 1000), components of vector A (N-dimensional vector), and components of vector B (N-dimensional vector) in this order.



Output
-----------
The program must print the dot product of A and B. 
Print to the sixth decimal place, using the following code.  

    printf("%0.6f\n", answer);

Do not forget to print a new line code at the end.  

Sample input
-----------
    3
    0.1 0.2 0.3
    0.1 0.2 0.3


sample output
-----------
    0.140000
